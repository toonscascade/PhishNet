1. Analyze URLs for potential phishing indicators
2. Display a risk score and level
3. Show detailed findings
4. Optionally log results to a JSON file

Example output:
```
==================================================
PhishNet Analysis Results
==================================================

URL: https://example.com/login/verify
Risk Level: 🟡 MEDIUM
Risk Score: 35/100

Findings:
• Contains suspicious keyword: login
• Contains suspicious keyword: verify

==================================================
```

## How It Works

PhishNet uses several techniques to detect potential phishing URLs:

1. **Keyword Analysis**: Checks for common phishing-related keywords
2. **Domain Analysis**: Identifies suspicious domain patterns
3. **URL Structure**: Analyzes URL structure for red flags
4. **Typosquatting Detection**: Uses fuzzy string matching to detect similar domains
