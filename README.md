- üé® Visual risk indicators using emojis
- üîÑ Typosquatting detection using fuzzy string matching
- üìù Optional logging of results to JSON file
- üéØ Detection of:
  - Suspicious keywords
  - IP addresses instead of domains
  - URL shorteners
  - Excessive subdomains

## Installation

## How It Works

PhishNet+ uses several techniques to detect potential phishing URLs:

1. **Keyword Analysis**: Checks for common phishing-related keywords
2. **Domain Analysis**: Identifies suspicious domain patterns
3. **URL Structure**: Analyzes URL structure for red flags
4. **Typosquatting Detection**: Uses fuzzy string matching to detect similar domains
